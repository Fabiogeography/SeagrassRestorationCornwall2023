code1 makes the best fitting multivariate model, not including spatial autocorrelation

code2 runs model diagnostic checks and plots relationships

code3 adds in a spatial autocovariate
code3_spat_MountsBay_m1&2 tests whether both models for Mounts Bay still perform equally well. 

code4 predicts the models using a spatial autocovariate, in order to evaluate site suitability for seagrass restoration

code5 calculates a MESS surface, which indicates which areas lie outside the range of environmental data used to construct models. See the code and report for more information. 

All codes are written for FalHelford and Mounts Bay regions.
